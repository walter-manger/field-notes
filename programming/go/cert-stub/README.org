#+TITLE: Certifier - Generate Certificates for Domains

* Running the Server
  
#+begin_src bash
  go run main.go
#+end_src

Example Output

#+begin_src bash
2019/06/17 23:11:38 Starting Cert-Stub Server...

#+end_src

** Features

   1. Generates Certificates for domains /Concurrently/
   2. Will only generate certificates when there isn't already a certificate that is no expired
   3. Shuts down gracefully, meaning that it will wait until all jobs are /Done/ before shutting down.

* Running the Integration Tests
  
#+begin_src bash
  go test -tags=integration
#+end_src

Try running this multiple times or even in parallel to see how the server handles it.
