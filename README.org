*** TODO Real World Haskell

    Another pretty good resource for learning real-world programming with Haskell.

** Scheme / Chicken

   
*** TODO Reference Materials
    
    - Environment: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/scheme
    - SICP Exercises: https://github.com/zv/SICP-guile
    - SICP Book: https://github.com/zv/SICP-guile

*** DONE Environment Setup
  
    We're using Chicken and Guile, so install them from brew.
    
    #+begin_src bash
      brew update && brew install chicken && brew install guile
    #+end_src

    Since I am using Spacemacs, there is a layer for interacting with Scheme (Chicken/Guile). 
   
    Add the scheme layer to emacs.
 
    #+begin_src elisp
      (defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
        (setq-default
         dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
         '(scheme)))
    #+end_src

    
** Python

*** Data Structures

**** TODO List

     #+begin_src python
       # Initializing
       numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

       # Getting by Index
       first = numbers[0]

     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : None


**** TODO Tuple

**** Dict

** Javascript

*** Definitions

**** Prototypical Inheritance
     
**** Closure
     
     #+begin_quote
     A /closure/ is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
     
     -- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures
     #+end_quote

     In other words, a /closure/ is a function that is created in the body of another function, which has access to the outer function's scope. 

     _Why?_ It is JavaScript's way of avoiding global scope, aka Encapsulation.

     #+begin_src js
       function init() {
           var name = 'George Washington';
           function displayName() { // <-- This is a closure
               console.log(name);   // <-- Has access to the name var outside of its scope
           }
           displayName();
       }

       init();
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : George Washington
     : undefined
